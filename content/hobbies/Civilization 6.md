Thank you Sid Meier! Thank you POTATO MCWHISKEY! ðŸ¥”

## Amenities
- Increase this in the early game by having more unique copies of luxuries worked
	- Sell extras to the AI
- In the later game, choose cities with good overlap and then you can put some high-value entertainment complexes. Turns out city overlap is a good thing, actually. 
- More amenities -> happier cities -> more productive by some %

## The best starting tiles
- GRASSLAND HILLS!! 2 production 2 food
- On top of a luxury, which gives the luxury automatically instead of needing to research it

## Food & housing in cities
- each population requires 2 food. and you need 2 spare housing for normal growth rate. otherwise your excess food is useless.
- Growth > production when you first found a city. So it's always good to focus food, get a granary and a monument.

## Victory types
- Culture - win a total # of tourists OVER other civilizations
- Religion - 
- Domination - destroy all the other civs?
- Science - complete all the space race projects
