## Recommended gameplay strategies

- If given a supplier ({mavis, greg}) in the beginning of a non-supplies battle mod, get it and go for the supply asap
- get the blue boxes asap for the 2 shoes per box - eliminates the need to get chickens (the boots were part of a balancing update)
- bust another squad in the first minute of the game for good luck üçÄ
- If only obtaining a supplier in the early-middle of the game, get Mavis for the healing. 
## Favorite combinations

- trader + loot goblins or loot pi√±atas
	- Honestly trader might be a top 3 unit for me
- hog rider + shelly
	- Unfortunately hog rider is a non-negotiable... walking is so slow...
- bandit when in any world with the medium-sized skeletons in a group of 3
	- it's just a free gems printer!
	- bandit in dopplegangers mode is also super broken because they become a gems printer

## Least favorite battle mods:

- baby battle
	- too used to the powerups from unit upgrades
	- This got removed in August 2024! Thank goodness
-  [[#How to play doppelgangers battle mod|doppelgangers]]
	- variety builds a good team. seems like barbarian king might be the best in this mode?
	- although one time I had a team of dynamike and someone was trying to squad bust me, and my dynamikes threw 2 attacks and boomed all of them (clumped up, I guess)

## Quirks:

- "brain rot game"
- I keep accidentally calling it brawl stars but I actually couldn't get through the tutorial of that one. Only gets confused bc it's also made by supercell and I have plenty of friends that like that game better. 

## Strategies

### When to deprioritize getting the boots boxes
- golden boots - no point in collecting extra shoes
- turbo - you'll get enough extra shoes anyway
- doppelganger - first check if chickens are an option, then use a fusion to maximize boot output
- spooky world - monsters are too strong so aim for some form of healing (medic, poco, mavis, trader) before approaching too many

### How to play doppelgangers battle mod
- if you need money, get goblins. if you need boots, get chickens.
- periodically switch to some suppliers so you can stock up on money/healing
