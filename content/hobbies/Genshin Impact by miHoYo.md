I made an account in 2020 but got scared by the hilichurls. So I have a pretty low ID number but not many hours played. 

It's hard to get a character to level 80! I like the changes they've made between 2022 and 2024 for quality of life though. Double XP, shortcut buttons, etc. Nice that they're paying attention to how their users play the game. The game is fun to play with friends, but mostly because it's easier to get carried. One time I couldn't finish the world leveling quest fight so I gave my laptop to my roommate and watched her beat the bots for me. Thanks :)

5 stars are so cool! The first 5* that I got was Yae Miko. The one I've used the most is probably Kaedehara Kazuha.

	- Makes something like the below (not my image, credits to the above reddit link)
	> Bars is number of substats and the dots is how good the roll was. So you have 1 substat of crit rate and it was quality 2 out of 4. On your goblet you have 2 rolls of crit dmg, 1 was quality 1 the other one was quality 2. Substat quality is 1-4 with the actual value determined by the substat and the rarity of the artifact.
