## The ideal scenario

Get a good grip ü§ö on what people prefer, especially around price range and comfort level. After sufficient gathering of information, just have their trust that you'll come up with a good plan. If one person is in charge, it's easier to ask for thoughts on a full plan rather than building it step by step with input along the way. 

Make sure to be clear about the deadline to flake!
