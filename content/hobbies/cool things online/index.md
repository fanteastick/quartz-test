> Slurps webpages and saves them as clean, uncluttered Markdown. Think Pocket, but better. 

## Steps & plugins for scraping things off the web:
1) Use the slurp plugin, fill in the URL to download
2) Skim the content for any artifacts that might be poorly formatted, especially trailing image links etc.
3) Use the Local Images Plus plugin [here](https://github.com/Sergei-Korneev/obsidian-local-images-plus) to download the current file's image links into png's in the vault
4) Wait a few seconds and save the file so things get renamed etc.
5) Run "Nuke Orphans - Trash orphaned attachments" [here](https://github.com/sandorex/nuke-orphans-plugin) to delete any unused image files that might be left over.
