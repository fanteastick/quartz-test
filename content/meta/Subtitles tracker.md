The query

```
TABLE subtitle as "Subtitle", file.folder as "Folder"
WHERE subtitle != null AND draft != "true"
SORT file.name ASC
```

Also, make sure the subtitle property type is a string, not a list. 

<!-- QueryToSerialize: TABLE subtitle as "Subtitle", file.folder as "Folder" WHERE subtitle != null AND draft != "true" SORT file.name ASC -->
