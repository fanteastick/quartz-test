Amazing that it took me this long to get here... lol...

Supplies needed:

- pi
- hdmi cord <> microhdmi adapter
- ethernet
- mouse and keyboard that connect over usb

## Following da "getting started"

[Getting started - Raspberry Pi Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html)

### Downloading OS

[Raspberry Pi OS â€“ Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) downloaded the raspberry pi OS using raspberry pi imager for windows

It's a raspberry pi 4 B. Scrounged up a usbc -> many other ports converter to download the image. lol. my usual login details and named it pi1. 

Writing started at 9:15pm, it errored out a little bit??? something up with the converter, probably. 

Forgot to do some ssh config so i'm going back to do that

## Goals

- [ ] SSH into it
- [ ] PiHole
