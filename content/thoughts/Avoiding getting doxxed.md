I saw a twitter thread where people datamined out some dude (JiaT75 of the [XZ Utils backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor))'s identity based on git commit location + emails connecting across accounts + data breach content... data is definitely being sold so I don't really agree with things like "I'm not an important person or doing anything weird, so I don't care about data privacy or online anonymity". To some degree it would be nice to be anonymous online but lowkey it might be too late for me. I can't think of any more good usernames to start fresh with XDDD. A few years back I tried to set up a whole new email, fake name, separate out content between accounts, but it's easy to make mistakes, and I soon gave up a fully anonymous account. Stay diligent out there!

## Avoid giving these things when browsing online

Think about if the website actually really needs the information... usually they don't! For example, if you're downloading the free trial of a software and they have a form for you to fill out before you get your download. I will gladly give them completely false information. Another example: logging into a public Wi-Fi and you need to give them your email to get online. 

- Location
- Full name
- Email
- Age/birthday
- Address
- Family information
- Current company, work history, current role

## Avoid talking/posting about these things online

- Travel plans: where, when, and how long
- Home security system and setup
- Photos that have your keys in them
	- easy to trace and copy
- Photos or videos of the street view from where you live. It's easier than you think it'd be to identify a location just based on the view. Like [Rainbolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Rainbolt) on Geoguessr! (2024-12-17)

## Identity theft, payments, scams

- Don't click on suspicious links, even in your personal email
- Don't take photos with any IDs in it, even the back side
- Don't share your password over a phone call! 

## Use actual unique passwords, aka a legit password management system

Imagine: you have two accounts under two different usernames publicly, but using the same email and password on both accounts. Then, the platform(s) with these accounts experience a data leak, and your email and password and usernames are all mapped out for the public to see. Put two and two together, and they'll know that it's the same person between the two accounts.

Sim swapping!

[SIM swap scam - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam) 2024-08-05

> A SIM swap scam (also known as port-out scam, SIM splitting, simjacking, and SIM swapping) is a type of account takeover fraud that generally targets a weakness in two-factor authentication and two-step verification in which the second factor or step is a text message (SMS) or call placed to a mobile telephone.
