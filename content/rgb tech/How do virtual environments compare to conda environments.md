## How do virtual environments compare to conda environments

> Python virtual environments are the light version of the conda environments.
> 
> Virtual environments are a native tool to Python developers, and they provide a functionality similar to that of the conda environments. The main difference is that they rely on the _Python package manager_. **Libraries and programs that do not belong to the Python ecosystem can't be installed with these tools**. In these cases, one must rely on the operating system's ability to install programs.
> 
> The Python package manager improved a lot in the past decade. Today, no one has issues installing numpy, pyqt, or scikit with a simple `pip` command. However, many of these packages still rely on libraries available at an operating-system level. For example, Python itself is grabbed from the operating system and not installed purposefully on each environment. **Virtual environments are a very good tool to isolate dependencies across projects that rely mostly on Python packages**.
