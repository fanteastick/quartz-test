I learned how to crochet! Thank you to my friend whose name starts with a J. Me and my friend whose name starts with a K learned at the same time, although I borrowed J-friend's yarn and hook. The thing I'm best at making right now is a headphone sprout, although I also learned from youtube videos to make a granny square and a simple flower. I got some brown yarn for myself too. Thank you Joann's the fabric store!

I think it's reasonably easy to learn how to follow a written pattern. It helps a lot more if you follow the YouTube tutorial too.

### Sprout

This is the exact YouTube video I followed: [Crochet Leaf Sprout | Multipurpose Tie - Crochet Leaf Bookmark | Cable Tie | Headphones Accessory - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrhqPdazVCg)

- Start by ch10

Leaf 1

- Skip the first loop
- sc, hdc, dc, dc, tc
	- The tc is the midpoint and then you're shrinking the leaf again
- dc, dc, hdc, sc
	- This sc is the turnaround point, so go to the other side of the first ch
- sl st
- Copy the prev steps to make the second half of the leaf

In between the two leaves, ch1

Leaf 2

- copy leaf 1

Down the middle of leaf 2

- sl st through the middle
- then do a sc into the center ch1

Making the stem and the loop

- ch40 ish, and then loop back and sl st into the 15th or so
- sl st all the way up
- sc into the center ch1

Down the middle of leaf 1

- tie it off at the end

Done!
