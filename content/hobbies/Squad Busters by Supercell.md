> Busted! üí¨ Announcer, Squad Busters
## Recommended gameplay strategies

- If given a supplier ({mavis, greg}) in the beginning of a non-supplies battle mod, get it and go for the supply asap
- get the blue boxes asap for the 2 shoes per box - eliminates the need to get chickens (the boots were part of a balancing update)
- bust another squad in the first minute of the game for good luck üçÄ
- If only obtaining a supplier in the early-middle of the game, get Mavis for the healing. 
## Favorite combinations

- trader + loot goblins or loot pi√±atas
	- Honestly trader might be a top 3 unit for me
- hog rider + shelly
	- Unfortunately hog rider is a non-negotiable... walking is so slow...
- bandit when in any world with the medium-sized skeletons in a group of 3
	- it's just a free gems printer!
	- bandit in dopplegangers mode is also super broken because they become a gems printer

## Least favorite battle mods:

- baby battle
	- too used to the powerups from unit upgrades
	- This got removed in August 2024! Thank goodness
-  [[#How to play doppelgangers battle mod|doppelgangers]]
	- variety builds a good team. seems like barbarian king might be the best in this mode?
	- although one time I had a team of dynamike and someone was trying to squad bust me, and my dynamikes threw 2 attacks and boomed all of them (clumped up, I guess)

## Quirks:

- "brain rot game"
- I keep accidentally calling it brawl stars but I actually couldn't get through the tutorial of that one. Only gets confused bc it's also made by supercell and I have plenty of friends that like that game better. 

## Strategies

### When to deprioritize getting the boots boxes
- golden boots - no point in collecting extra shoes
- turbo - you'll get enough extra shoes anyway
- doppelganger - first check if chickens are an option, then use a fusion to maximize boot output
- spooky world - monsters are too strong so aim for some form of healing (medic, poco, mavis, trader) before approaching too many

### How to play doppelgangers battle mod
- if you need money, get goblins. if you need boots, get chickens.
- periodically switch to some suppliers so you can stock up on money/healing

## December 2024 update

This is the best update ever. They added 4 game modes instead of just normal gameplay and my favorite is definitely squad league, where you can pick the your team comp. I've gotten some 800+ gem runs on there. The original game mode is now called like Gemstone Rush or something. Also they added a duo queue mode where you collect gems with a partner. Showdown is a 5-man free for all which is pretty cool but kind of stressful. The gui updates are great too, and I like the changes to the awards system. Instead of win streaks, you get 9 taps for a 1st, 8 for 2nd, etc. Also you can just use a multiplier when you feel like it, so I've gotten 12x4 of some commons. 

## Squad league ideal comp

Must have:

- A supplier (I like greg over mavis)
- Hog rider
- Trader
- Bea (I love Bea, plus I have the Bee Bea skin)
- Archer queen - prefer ranged over melee tbh

I prefer to skip:

- Dynamike - too squishy, not enough damage output
- Chicken - I'll get boots elsewhere
- Dr. T - the minion he spawns is so useless I'm sorry
