When in obsidian: [Hide specific notes and links from the Graph view - Feature archive - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/hide-specific-notes-and-links-from-the-graph-view/65839) 

> You can already filter the graph view by filename or by tag. Click on the gear icon, chose “filter” and try: -tag:hidden to exclude any notes with the `#hidden` tag. -file:2022 to exclude any notes with the text “2022” in the filename

To do two in a row just separate by spaces.
