The short of it:

1. Reduce access, either forcibly or weaning
2. Find other things to fill up your time; but not a new, other social media - that defeats the point!
3. Settle into a routine where the social media is not part of it
4. Figure out if you have a decreased interest when you do return. If not, repeat! Or even consider -- don't return?

Of course it all starts with a desire to change. Through willpower and resisting temptation, I'm sure anyone can do it!

## Ways to reduce access

- uninstall the app on your phone, only access through computer
- log out after every time you use it (logging in again = extra effort = deters repeated use)
- disable notifications
- Use alternatives that are less addictive or attention grabbing than the original. For example, watching the same creator on YouTube shorts vs TikTok, where the recommendation algorithm is really good.
