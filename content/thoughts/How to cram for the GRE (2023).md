> There are so many words for "quick to fight" on the GRE. ðŸ’¬ me, 2023

## Thoughts

Standardized testing is a scam designed to wring money out of those aspiring to pursue further education... Unfortunately, it's probably one of the few ways to (semi)accurately compare students on actual metrics ("standardized"). The jury's out on whether those metrics are useful, but I *did* feel proud to have gotten a high score. It was like external validation that I'm not stupid ðŸ˜‚ 

## Vocab

There's some handy phone apps that work as flashcards. While doing the flashcards, try for the spelling bee approach where you break down what each component of the word means.

## (Used to be) a marathon

The test was changed in September 2023. 

Before that, total time: 3 hr 45 min. 6 sections, which were like 2 math 2 english 2 analytical writing. Unscored was totally a scam!! Now it's 1 hr 58 min long.

## At-home test vs at a testing center

On my first attempt, I tried taking it at a local testing center. I signed up for the afternoon slot because I wanted to take my time in the morning and not feel sleepy. Turns out, there was some software issue with the tests in the morning, so all the morning tests were delayed by an hour or two. And because the GRE was so long, there was not enough time for the afternoon test takers to complete the test (less than 4 hrs left). So I got a fee waiver and delayed the test. 

When taking the test at home, you can use a paper in a plastic sheet as a whiteboard, and you can use dry-erase markers. Pretty handy! You need to have good wifi, a quiet room, etc. I thought it was fine, but I've heard negative things about the online tests too.
