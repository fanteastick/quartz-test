The short of it:

1. Reduce access, either forcibly or weaning
2. Find other things to fill up your time; but not a new, other social media - that defeats the point!
3. Settle into a routine where the social media is not part of it
4. Figure out if you have a decreased interest when you do return. If not, repeat! Or even consider -- don't return?

Of course it all starts with a desire to change. Through willpower and resisting temptation, I'm sure anyone can do it!

## Ways to reduce access

- uninstall the app on your phone, only access through computer
- log out after every time you use it (logging in again = extra effort = deters repeated use)
- disable notifications, especially for certain apps
- Use alternatives that are less addictive or attention grabbing than the original. For example, watching the same creator on YouTube shorts vs TikTok, where the recommendation algorithm is really good.

## Other good tips

- Grayscale your phone: less color, less exciting, less addicting. 
- Put your phone in another room
- You can get this app or shortcut where it'll make you pause for 30 seconds to really think about whether you want to scroll or not. Or do 10 push ups before scrolling.
