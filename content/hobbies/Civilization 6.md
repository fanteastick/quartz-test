Thank you Sid Meier! Thank you POTATO MCWHISKEY! ðŸ¥”

## Amenities
- Increase this in the early game by having more unique copies of luxuries worked
	- Sell extras to the AI
- In the later game, choose cities with good overlap and then you can put some high-value entertainment complexes. Turns out city overlap is a good thing, actually. 
- More amenities -> happier cities -> more productive by some %

## The best starting tiles
- PLAINS HILLS!! 2 production 2 food after you settle
- On top of a luxury, which gives the luxury automatically instead of needing to research it
- Apparently settlers have higher sight range than warriors, if that helps with thinking about scouting
- Try to get a city down within 2-3 turns at MOST

## Food & housing in cities
- each population requires 2 food. and you need 2 spare housing for normal growth rate. otherwise your excess food is useless.
- Growth > production when you first found a city. So it's always good to focus food, get a monument.

## Religion and Pantheon
- Pantheon comes around 20-25 faith? So you have to plug in the card for +1 faith in the early game if you don't have a tile for it. 
- For religion, the AI likes to take Feed the World asap so the player probably won't get it. Maybe also work ethic? Choral music?

## Victory types
- Culture - win a total # of tourists OVER other civilizations
- Religion - make all other civs' majority religion become your civ's founded religion
- Domination - destroy all the other civs?
- Science - complete all the space race projects
- Diplomatic - only in the expansions. Win 20 victory points in a [variety of ways](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Victory_(Civ6)#Diplomacy) 

## Modding

Go into the steam workshop and add some nice ones. For some of them, I'm amazed that they're not already in the game, but I guess that would have introduced a lot of visual clutter if you don't know what's going on. I did NOT understand how to fix housing or amenities until I got the mods though. 

## City-States

Pay attention to the Suzerain special bonus! Some of them are actually quite cool, like the Lahore with their special unit. Others are more useless, e.g. if you got the one that gives gold for international trade routes, but you're playing as Japan...

## Barbarians

They have spotted you if you see a little red exclamation mark over the head, especially scouts. Then they go back to their encampment, and then send a horde of barbarians. Apparently they can't take capital cities but they can be super annoying. 

## Wonders

Are a distraction!
