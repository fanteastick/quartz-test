Trusty dusty camera! 

In the year 2024 and onward I would honestly recommend that people get a mirrorless camera... dlsr is toooo heavy... too bulky... mirrorless is the way for sure...

Reach goals to do photography at:

- [ ] hackathon (or similar) awards ceremony or judging
- [ ] wedding
- [ ] concert
- [ ] aurora/northern lights
- [ ] modeling studio
- [ ] local sports games
