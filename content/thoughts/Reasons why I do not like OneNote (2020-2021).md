It's ok to spend money on tools to make your life easier. Like GoodNotes or Notability.

## Exporting and infinite canvas

- worst experience ever! this is the biggest deal breaker, your content is essentially unusable outside of OneNote
- Your work will get cut off at completely unexpected points or it'll be zoomed in because you made it too narrow, or zoomed out because you forgot that you left an extra mark all the way to the right
- Slow
- output PDF is shaped weird too
- Also why is the only viable option PDF?
- At some point I resorted to taking screenshots of my work because I had more freedom that way...

## Online sync lag

- Probably the only benefit to OneNote is the sync between PC and iPad, and they didn't even get that part right. 
- It's slow even if your internet connection is fine, so with a merge conflict you're at risk of losing previous work
	- During merge conflicts it's hard to tell the differences between each version and you can't see a preview
- Constantly waiting to see if your content finishes loading
- If you're loading a shared notebook it takes forever
## Copy-paste lag

- The more you write, the more individual objects in the document. when selecting all with a lasso tool to move, or copy/paste, it lags out if you have too much written down

## Search and handwriting search

It's bad. Because of the infinite canvas, you're constantly glitching around your document if you're flipping through the result. With the handwriting search, it only recognizes individual pen strokes as each letter, so if your handwriting merges together some letters, it won't identify the correct letter.

Also you can't search in just the current document? It searches in your entire notebook...

And it's slow too.

## File structure

What was going on inside their heads... Notebooks -> sections and subsections -> notes... HUH??
