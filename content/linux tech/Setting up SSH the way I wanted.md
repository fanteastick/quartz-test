## Tips that have been copied from a Perplexity response

Thank you perplexity ðŸ–¤

- Enable SSH to start automatically on boot. This is typically done by default when you install the SSH server.
- Configure your network to use DHCP or set a static IP address. This ensures your PC gets an IP address when it boots up.
- Consider enabling Wake-on-LAN (WoL) in your BIOS/UEFI settings. This allows you to turn on the PC remotely using a special network packet.
